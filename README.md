This is our first game ever created, hope you enjoy! The game is a top down 2d roguelike.


## Important things to know!
- You may have to turn up the sound a bit in the options, it might be a bit low at the start. (there is music, gun sound, and movement sound)
- The sound is too quiet for all the volumes if they are put below like 66.
- Clarification about the card system: 
- The health card increases your MAX hp, each mob has a chance to drop a health orb pick them up to heal!
- The damage card increase your damage by 1.
- The crit card just increases your critical hit chance, which doubles your current damage for the hit.
- The enemies do scale as each wave progresses.
